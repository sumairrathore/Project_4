## Project Proposal
The aim of our project is to create a Sports Analytics Dashboard that provides users with statistics and visualizations for sports data, such as player performance, team rankings, and game outcomes.
The dashboard will allow users to explore and analyze the data based on different filters, enabling them to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.
The dashboard page will include multiple charts that update from the same data, providing users with a comprehensive view of the sports analytics.
We will utilize a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and a database (e.g., SQL, MongoDB, SQLite) to develop an interactive and informative dashboard.

## Data Source
[Kaggle Fifa 20 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset?select=players_20.csv)

- `data/`: This directory contains subdirectories and files related to data processing and storage.
    - `db/`: This directory stores the SQLite database file (`database.db`).
    - `cleaned_data/`: This directory contains cleaned data in CSV format for each year from 2015 to 2020.
    - `raw_data/`: This directory contains raw data in CSV format for each year from 2015 to 2020, as well as a file (`teams_and_leagues.csv`) containing information about teams and leagues.
    - `clean_data.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains code for cleaning the raw data and generating the cleaned data CSV files.
- `data_visualization/`: This directory contains files related to data visualization and presentation.
    - `.ipynb_checkpoints/`: This directory may contain checkpoints generated by Jupyter Notebook.
    - `Fifa File/`: This directory may contain additional files related to FIFA data.
    - `Images/`: This directory may contain images used for data visualization.
    - `Final Work.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file likely contains code for data visualization and analysis.
    - `Final.pdf`: This file is likely the final report or presentation of the project.
- `static/`: This directory contains static files such as CSS and JavaScript.
    - `css/`: This directory contains the CSS file (`style.css`) for styling the web pages.
    - `imgs/`: This directory contains images used in the web pages.
    - `js/`: This directory contains JavaScript files (`player.js` and `logic.js`) for client-side functionality.
- `templates/`: This directory contains HTML templates for the web pages.
    - `index.html`: This template represents the home page of the dashboard.
    - `league.html`: This template represents the league data page.
    - `player.html`: This template represents the player data page.
- `app.py`: This is the main Python file that contains the Flask application code. It defines the routes and handles the requests from the client.
    - The `index()` function renders the `index.html` template and passes player data to it.
    - The `player()` function renders the `player.html` template and passes player data to it.
    - The `league()` function renders the `league.html` template.
    - The `get_table_data()` function is an API endpoint that returns table data as JSON.
    - The `get_player_info()` function is another API endpoint that returns player information as JSON.
    - The `favicon()` function returns a 204 No Content response for the favicon.ico file.

## Dependencies
1. `pip install flask pandas sqlalchemy`

## Development Start Up
1. To start the server Flask app make sure you are in the root directory of the project and run `python app.py`
2. After running `python app.py` the server should be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
3. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your broswer and you should see the site.
    - The main page of the application (`index.html`) will display the player data fetched from the database.

## To Work On
- Loading the entire dataset takes a long time to load, so need to find a quicker way to load the data.
    - There are 2 lines like this `query = f"SELECT * FROM {table} LIMIT 100"` in the `app.py` file.
        - The `LIMIT 100` must be removed from both to load all the data onto the page, but until we find a quicker way of loading the data for viewing on the site it, this limit will make the site load faster for development purposes.

## Presentation Notes
The project is a FIFA analytics dashboard that allows users to explore and analyze FIFA player data based on different filters. The dashboard is built using Flask, a Python web framework, and utilizes a SQLite database to store and retrieve the data.

The project structure consists of several files and directories:
- The `data` directory contains subdirectories for raw and cleaned data, as well as a SQLite database file (`database.db`). The cleaned data directory contains CSV files for each year of FIFA player data.
- The `data_visualization` directory contains files related to data visualization, including a Jupyter Notebook (`Final Work.ipynb`) and a PDF report (`Final.pdf`).
- The `static` directory contains subdirectories for CSS, images, and JavaScript files used in the web application.
- The `templates` directory contains HTML templates for different pages of the web application, including the index page (`index.html`), player data page (`player.html`), and league data page (`league.html`).
- The `app.py` file is the main Flask application file that defines the routes and handles the logic for each page of the web application.
- The `README.md` file provides documentation and instructions for running the project.

The `app.py` file defines several routes:
- The `/` route renders the index page and retrieves data from the SQLite database to display a table of FIFA player data.
- The `/player` route renders the player data page and retrieves player names from the database to populate a dropdown menu. Selecting a player triggers an AJAX request to fetch additional player information.
- The `/league` route renders the league data page.
- The `/data` route is an API endpoint that returns table data from the database as a JSON response.
- The `/player_info` route is another API endpoint that returns player information based on the selected player.

The HTML templates (`index.html`, `player.html`, `league.html`) define the structure and layout of the web pages. They include placeholders for displaying the data retrieved from the backend and utilize CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files for styling and interactivity.

Overall, the project provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and analyzing FIFA player data, allowing users to filter and view information about players and leagues.
